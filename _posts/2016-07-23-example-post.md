Scholarly communication is a lifecycle from discovery to dissemination

## What is discovery?
The ability to find #new# information and connect to it. this case we are using a simple text markup language called Markdown to create and format the content on the pages. Jekyll can interpret this and convert it to html that can be rendered in any browser.

## Why is ?
A static website, simply put, is easier to manage than just about any other option out there for a simple website. Since it does not rely on any additional web application, it can be hosted on any webhosting server. It does not require regular updates like many dynamic websites such as WordPress or Drupal require. Everything that the website needs to work is contained within one directory, making it incredibly easy to move.

## How is this template different?
This template has been optimized for ease of use. In the next set of instructions you will see that there are less than five files that you need to edit in order to customize the look of the website.
